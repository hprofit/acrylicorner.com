*"You started doing this because it was f-g fun, you know?
It has to be fun
Otherwise, you're just torturing yourself, you know?"*
\- Kill the Noise

I've been gaming as far back as I can remember, starting with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on Sega Genesis and Super Mario Bros. 3
on Nintendo and ever since have wanted to create games and experiences that I could share with others.

I went to [Vantage Career Center](http://vantagecareercenter.com/programs/information-technology/network-systems.aspx)
to kickstart my knowledge of computer science.
After graduating high school, I attended [Shawnee State University](http://www.shawnee.edu/) where I attained my
Bachelor of Science in Digital Simulation and Gaming Engineering Technology.

Since then I've been working at [Information Control Company](http://icctechnology.com/) as a consultant and now
Senior Web Developer.

I've given several presentations covering topics such as Jasmine testing, how to use Git and Github, and Swarming
A.I. and work on several side projects of my own, most of which can be found on my github.
