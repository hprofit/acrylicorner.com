*"You started doing this because it was f-g fun, you know?
It has to be fun
Otherwise, you're just torturing yourself, you know?"*
\- Kill the Noise

I've been gaming as far back as I can remember, starting with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on Sega Genesis and Super Mario Bros. 3 on Nintendo and ever since have wanted to create games and experiences that I could share with others.

I went to [Vantage Career Center](http://vantagecareercenter.com/programs/information-technology/network-systems.aspx) to kickstart my knowledge of computer science. After graduating high school, I attended [Shawnee State University](http://www.shawnee.edu/) where I attained my Bachelor of Science in Digital Simulation and Gaming Engineering Technology.

From 2013 to 2017 I worked at [Information Control Company](http://icctechnology.com/) Senior Web Developer and consultant.

Starting in August of 2017 I started attending [DigiPen Institute of Technlogy](https://www.digipen.edu/) for my Master of Science in Computer Science with a focus in Graphics Programming.
