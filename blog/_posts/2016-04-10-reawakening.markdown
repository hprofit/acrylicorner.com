So I've been putting a lot of thought into my career lately. I enjoy web development a lot and I've learned a lot 
over the last 3 years, picking up javascript which was completely new to me, learning HTML and CSS, 
becoming a senior Angular/Front End Web Developer. A lot of my progress is thanks to 
[Scott Preston](http://www.scottpreston.com/) who has proven to be a great mentor and friend. I have no regrets regarding
my job choice so far. It has proven an invaluable experience straight out of college and put me into contact with 
some amazing people. However, I think it's time for me to move on, to answer my true calling.

Ever since I was a young kid of, oh I don't know, four or five years old I've been wanting to do one thing: create 
video games! While my motivation may have dimmed slightly over the last couple years as I got further into improving my skills
as a web developer, it has recently started burning again, brighter than ever! Now is the time for me to set out and
go for the career I've always wanted and this website is the first step in a series that will continue for the rest of my life
in the pursuit of my true passion. 

It's a daunting thing to do, diving into an industry like this. I know it's not easy work 
and at times can seem thankless, but the people that work tirelessly to make so many amazing games all have one thing 
in common: passion. 

So what are my next steps? I've identified several key things I need to start doing and I'll be documenting my progress
along the way as well as sharing any knowledge I gain. 

*   Learn C++
*   Learn Data Structures
*   Specialize
*   Network and Improve People Skills
*   Grow My Skills Ever Outward

C++
---
C++ is the go to language for game development, and not without good reason. It's a powerful language that gives the user
very precise control and excellent opportunities for optimization. That said, it has it's faults: it's error prone. As
Ben Parker said, "with great power comes great responsibility." The same is true of a language that lets you fiddle with
something as low level as the location of variables in memory. While I have some experience in it and it's cousins, it's
been awhile since I properly did much compiled programming work. So the first step is to really dig in and get to know
the language to the point I currently know Javascript. 

Being on my website you've probably (definitely) run into my Artificial Intelligence demonstrations, they're kind of 
hard to miss. So one of the first things I'm going to do is convert all my AI demos into C++ as sort of a warm up. Get
familiar with working in compiled land again, know the variable types, work with pointers, everything. 

My [Chip's Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip%27s_Challenge) remake that is currently being built in Javascript
will also be redone entirely in C++ and (likely) in 3D, even if I have to use some simple assets. All in the name of
practice and sharpening my skills. 

Learning Data Structures
------------------------
There are a plethora of advanced data structures out there that are used for optimized storage and lookup of information. 
Within the context described above, I'll be teaching myself and making use of [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) to really 
dig into the specifics and learn how they're used.

Specialize
----------
This step may very likely come later when I've gotten a more grasp of the first two. It's something I've always kind of
known about but never dug too far into. Game development is a multi-faceted process, far deeper than the current one I'm
used to. It involves everything from tools programming, game play, or graphics all the way to server/client, platform, 
and engine programming. It's honestly a little daunting at this point! I could tell you a couple things I'd rather 
*not* do, but everything else is equally interesting and inviting at this point and it all really ties into the same
idea in the end: making an awesome game! So perhaps this will come with experience or maybe I already have a strong
preference and just don't know it yet. Regardless, it will take some self discovery and hard work to find where I fit
in the best.

Network and Improve People Skills
---------------------------------
I'm a shy and quiet guy by nature so reaching out to new people has never been a strength of mine. I've been working on 
improving slowly over time, having given several presentations to increasingly larger groups, performing interviews
for potential candidates, and being interviewed myself. It's a difficult and very personal hurdle to overcome but I 
believe it is a necessary one. 

Also, I'll be headed to [ECGC](http://ecgconf.com/) with my friend [Wesley Paquette](http://wesleypaquettedesigns.com/) 
on April 19th through April 21st and meeting (hopefully) lots of new people there as well!

Grow My Skills Ever Outward
---------------------------
Last but certainly not least is the desire to improve and learn. It's not a skill so much as a desire to continue forward
rather than stagnate and grow complacent. Picking up the entire front end web dev stack that I got from my work so far
and speaking with some individuals in the industry has only served to highlight the importance of this. 

You can never know enough! One must always strive to learn everything they can! 

Closing Thoughts
----------------
I think of this as a sort of coming out of a lull or climbing back up the hump from a dip in a roller coaster ride. I 
know what I want to do and I've been telling others for years that the only thing stopping them from reaching their
goals is them. It's about time I listen to my own advice and get out there!
